10. Add knoted Beancurd Sheets, red paper, Onion Green(not chopped). Then cover the pot and wait for sometime(depends on
    the water left in pot), remember to check the water level, we don't want to charred it.

11. Once the water level gets low, you can pick the Onion Green out and throw them. Maybe taste a piece of pork and decide whether
    you want to stew it longer, since we want the pork become soft to chew. If so, add more water and keep wait.

12. When you think the pork is soft enough for you, remove the pot cover and keep frying. We want the pork to absorb some soup
    in order to make it tasty. Then at the time you believe you are done, close the fire and try a piece, you still get
    this chance to add some salt if you want to do so. Finally, serve out on a plate, sprinkle with some chopped green onion.
